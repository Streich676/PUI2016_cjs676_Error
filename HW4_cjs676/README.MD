In this assignment I worked with Richard Vescsler and a little with Jonathan Pichot

Assigment#1

The CitibikeReview_cjs676.md is located at the url below. 

https://github.com/Streich676/PUI2016_jmv423/blob/master/HW3_jmv423/CitibikeReview_cjs676.md

I was forced to use jmv423 rather than the first choice of Francis Ko (fk759). This was due to the link being incorrect at first and my difficulty finding his GitHub.

Assignment #3 and #4

For this assignment I worked with Richard Vecsler and a little with Ian Wright and Jonathan Pichot. Richard ran into a problem on Assignment #4 which we could not resolve (a bit of code would not run, I really dont know why.) I was able to run the code on my computer however, I did have trouble utilizing the skelton notebooks provided and I had to cut and paste from Github. I believe my Anaconda/iPython may have a problem with something to do with its JSON file. I apologize if the format is not a clean as it could be. I will work with some classmates tomorrow to see if they can resolve the issue or I will just re-install the iPython Format. 
Updata: When I forked the repository from GitHub I was able to load the notebooks in the compute environment.
