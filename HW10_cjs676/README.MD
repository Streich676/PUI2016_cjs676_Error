For this assignment I worked alone.  I feel like I had to lean heavily on Dr. Kashuk's Lab at first but I felt more confident toward
the end of the assignment



Analysis:
The changing season did not have and effect on the spatial autocorrelation. Aside from a few Census Tracts the results were largely the same for both seasons.

In the summer there is a significant Cold spot in the lower part of the Upper East Side. In the Winter the Brooklyn Navy Yard becomes a cold spot.

From the map above it seems clear that there is not much difference in spatial correlation due to the change of season and thus weather.
